# Genetic Algorithm for Polynomial Function Optimization

## Overview
A Python implementation of a genetic algorithm designed to find global maxima of polynomial functions. The algorithm evolves candidate solutions through biologically-inspired operations including selection, crossover, and mutation.

## Key Features
- **Polynomial Support**: Optimizes functions of form:
  ```math
  f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0
